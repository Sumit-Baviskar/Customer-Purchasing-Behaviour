# üìà Customer Purchasing Behaviour Detection üìà


# üõí **Problem Statement:** üõí  

The Chips category of a supermarket has shown fluctuating performance over recent months, with unclear insights into customer purchasing behaviors, segment preferences, and buying patterns. The lack of understanding of these behaviors hinders the supermarket's ability to align its product offerings, promotional activities, and marketing strategies with customer needs, potentially leading to missed sales opportunities and reduced customer satisfaction.  

The goal is to analyze customer transactions and segment data to uncover the key purchasing behaviors, trends, and differences between customer groups. Specifically, the project seeks to address questions such as:  

- Which customer segments contribute most to total sales in the Chips category?  
- What are the purchasing patterns of different segments in terms of frequency, spend, and preferred products?  
- How do seasonal trends and demographic factors influence purchasing decisions?  
- Are there significant differences in purchasing behavior between key customer groups?  

By solving these questions, the analysis will provide actionable insights for the Category Manager to optimize product offerings, tailor marketing strategies, and improve the overall performance of the Chips category. The ultimate objective is to drive customer satisfaction, maximize sales, and enhance profitability.  


# üìò Introduction: üìò

As a member of Company's retail analytics team, I have been approached by the Category Manager for Chips to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer purchasing behavior for this product category.

This analysis is crucial as it will offer insights into the different types of customers purchasing chips, their buying patterns, and how these behaviors vary across the region. By understanding these nuances, the client aims to make informed strategic decisions for the upcoming review of the Chips category, ensuring that the supermarket's offerings are aligned with customer preferences and market trends.

# üéØ Purpose: üéØ

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the transaction and customer data related to the Chips category, with a focus on uncovering key customer segments and their unique purchasing behaviors. By conducting a thorough examination of the data, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that highlight how different customer groups interact with the Chips category.

This involves assessing the frequency of purchases, average spend, preferred product types, and any seasonal variations in buying behavior.

Additionally, the analysis will involve a deep dive into transaction data to clean and identify any anomalies or outliers, ensuring that our insights are based on accurate and reliable information. This is followed by a detailed segmentation of customers based on their purchase history, demographics, and spending habits.

The insights derived from this analysis will inform a set of strategic recommendations that the Category Manager can use to guide their decisions for the upcoming category review. These recommendations will be tailored to address the needs of high-value customer segments, optimize product placement, and enhance promotional strategies. Ultimately, the goal is to support the supermarket in aligning its product offerings with customer demand, maximizing sales and profitability within the Chips category over the next six months.
