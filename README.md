Customer Purchasing Behaviour Analysis Project (Statistics Project)

# :green_book: **Introduction :** :green_book:

As a member of Company's retail analytics team, I have been approached by the Category Manager for Chips to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer purchasing behavior for this product category.

This analysis is crucial as it will offer insights into the different types of customers purchasing chips, their buying patterns, and how these behaviors vary across the region. By understanding these nuances, the client aims to make informed strategic decisions for the upcoming review of the Chips category, ensuring that the supermarket's offerings are aligned with customer preferences and market trends.

# :green_book: **Purpose :** :green_book:

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the transaction and customer data related to the Chips category, with a focus on uncovering key customer segments and their unique purchasing behaviors. By conducting a thorough examination of the data, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that highlight how different customer groups interact with the Chips category. This involves assessing the frequency of purchases, average spend, preferred product types, and any seasonal variations in buying behavior.

Additionally, the analysis will involve a deep dive into transaction data to clean and identify any anomalies or outliers, ensuring that our insights are based on accurate and reliable information. This is followed by a detailed segmentation of customers based on their purchase history, demographics, and spending habits.

The insights derived from this analysis will inform a set of strategic recommendations that the Category Manager can use to guide their decisions for the upcoming category review. These recommendations will be tailored to address the needs of high-value customer segments, optimize product placement, and enhance promotional strategies. Ultimately, the goal is to support the supermarket in aligning its product offerings with customer demand, maximizing sales and profitability within the Chips category over the next six months.
